# 🐹 My Go Learning Plan

Over the next weeks, I'm going to focus on learning the Go programming language through a mix of structured content and hands-on practice.

## What I'll Be Doing

- 📘 Taking the course **"Aprenda Golang do Zero! Desenvolva uma APLICAÇÃO COMPLETA!"**
- 📗 Reading and completing the official [**Tour of Go**](https://go.dev/tour)
- 💻 Doing practical exercises for each topic I learn
- 🛠️ Building small projects to apply what I study
- ✅ Writing clean, typed Go code (avoiding implicit typing when possible)
- 🧪 Exploring unit tests and Go's standard library tools (`go test`, `go fmt`, etc.)
- 🚀 Sharing my code and progress on GitHub
